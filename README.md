2. Fill in your name and phone number
3. Click "Start AI Call"
4. The AI will call you and ask questions
5. Answer each question verbally
6. Your responses will be stored automatically

### For Administrators

2. View all leads and their responses
3. Click on any lead to see their detailed responses
4. Monitor real-time statistics

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Tables

- **leads**: Stores lead information (ID, phone, name, call SID, etc.)
- **questions**: Stores the questions to ask leads
- **responses**: Stores lead responses with confidence scores

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/leads` - Get all leads
- `GET /api/leads/:leadId` - Get specific lead with responses
- `POST /api/call-user` - Initiate a call to a lead

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Questions

To add or modify questions, you can:

1. **Edit the database directly**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO questions (question_text, question_order) 
   VALUES ('Your new question?', 9);
   ```

2. **Modify the default questions** in `database.js`:
   ```javascript
   const defaultQuestions = [
     // ... existing questions
     { text: "Your new question?", order: 9 }
   ];
   ```

### Customizing the AI Voice

You can modify the voice responses in `server.js`:

```javascript
// In the /voice endpoint
twiml.say("Your custom greeting message");

// In the /voice/question endpoint
gather.say(`Your custom question format: ${currentQuestion.question_text}`);
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Update webhook URLs** in `api/voice.js`:
   ```javascript
   url: "https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/voice"
   ```

2. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard

3. **Deploy using Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Other Platforms

The system can be deployed to any Node.js hosting platform:
- Heroku
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS Lambda
- Google Cloud Functions

## üìä Monitoring

### Logs

Monitor the application logs for:
- Call initiation status
- Speech recognition results
- Database operations
- Error messages

### Twilio Console

Check the Twilio console for:
- Call logs and recordings
- Speech recognition accuracy
- Webhook delivery status

## üîí Security Considerations

- Store Twilio credentials securely
- Validate phone numbers before calling
- Implement rate limiting for call initiation
- Secure the admin dashboard in production
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Calls not connecting**
   - Check Twilio credentials
   - Verify phone number format (E.164)
   - Ensure webhook URLs are accessible

2. **Speech not recognized**
   - Check audio quality
   - Verify Twilio speech recognition settings
   - Review confidence scores in responses

3. **Database errors**
   - Check file permissions for SQLite
   - Verify database path
   - Review error logs

### Debug Mode
