# ðŸš€ Vercel Deployment Status

## Current Status: âœ… **FIXED**

The 404 NOT_FOUND error has been resolved by creating a proper Vercel serverless structure.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Created Proper API Structure**
- Added `api/index.js` as the main serverless function
- Updated `vercel.json` to route all requests to the API function
- Removed conflicting server.js configuration

### 2. **Updated Vercel Configuration**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Consolidated All Endpoints**
- All API routes now handled by single serverless function
- Static file serving included in the same function
- Proper error handling for all endpoints

## Testing Your Deployment

### 1. **Health Check**
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-25T14:12:53.661Z",
  "twilio_configured": false,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 2. **Main Page**
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
Should show the lead capture form

### 3. **Admin Dashboard**
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin`
Should show the admin interface

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: The code is now ready for deployment
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Add your Twilio credentials
3. **Test the Application**: Use the health check endpoint
4. **Configure Twilio Webhooks**: Update your Twilio phone number webhook URL

## Troubleshooting

If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**: Go to your Vercel dashboard â†’ Functions â†’ View logs
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Make sure all required variables are set
3. **Test Health Endpoint**: This should work even without Twilio credentials
4. **Check Build Status**: Ensure the deployment completed successfully

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify the GitHub repository is connected
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Test with the health endpoint first
