## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### **OpenAI Pricing (GPT-3.5-turbo)**
- **Input tokens**: ~$0.0015 per 1K tokens
- **Output tokens**: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
- **Typical call cost**: $0.01 - $0.05 per lead

### **Cost Optimization**
- Responses are kept concise
- Conversation history is limited
- Fallback to static questions if AI fails

## üõ°Ô∏è Fallback Behavior

### **When OpenAI is not configured:**
- ‚úÖ System continues to work
- ‚úÖ Uses static questions and responses
- ‚úÖ No errors or crashes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No AI features (graceful degradation)

### **When OpenAI API fails:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback to static responses
- ‚úÖ Error logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Call continues normally
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No AI features for that call

## üîß Customization

### **Modify AI Prompts**
Edit `ai-conversation.js` to customize:
- Greeting style and tone
- Question generation logic
- Response acknowledgment format
- Closing message structure
- Lead analysis criteria

### **Example Customization:**
```javascript
// In ai-conversation.js
const prompt = `Generate a greeting for a ${industry} company executive...`;
```

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### **AI Usage Metrics**
Monitor these in your logs:
- AI calls vs static calls
- API response times
- Error rates
- Cost per lead

### **Performance Optimization**
- Cache common responses
- Batch API calls when possible
- Monitor token usage
- Set rate limits if needed

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"OpenAI API key not found"**
   - Check environment variable spelling
   - Verify API key is valid
   - Restart server after adding key

2. **"AI analysis failed"**
   - Check API key permissions
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check OpenAI service status

3. **"Response too long"**

   - Modify prompts for brevity
   - Check conversation history size

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check AI service status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Test AI features
node test-ai.js

# Check environment variables
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```
